## 1. Project description
<span id="desc"></span>
The main content of this project is:
- **Draw 2D objects**: Line, Triangle (special triangles), Quadrilateral (Rectangle and Square), Oval (Circle and Ellipse), Regular Polygons, some special shapes like Arrow, Star, and mathematic symbols (Add, Minus, Times, Divide).
- **2D Filling algorithm**: Boundary Fill algorithm
- **2D Transformation**: Translation, Rotation, Scaling

The special thing is we can **select** a drawn shape and do something with it (filling, transforming,...). Therefore, I will store a **layer** value for every shape in order to handle this requirement.
